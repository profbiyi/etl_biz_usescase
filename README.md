This is a use case for an ETL class

Business Context:
* Company: A small to mid-sized retail company.
* Challenge: The company needs monthly insights into its sales performance, customer buying patterns, and inventory management.
ETL Process:
* 		Extract:
    * Sources: Monthly sales data files, often in CSV format, provided by the company's POS systems.
    * Data: Includes product ID, quantity sold, sale price, date of sale, customer ID, and store ID.
* 		Transform:
    * Cleaning: Correct data discrepancies, handle missing values, and remove duplicates.
    * Aggregation: Summarize data monthly for total sales, sales per product, and sales per store.
    * Enrichment: Merge with product information (like category, supplier) and customer demographics, if available.
* 		Load:
    * Destination: A data warehouse or a simpler database solution suitable for small to mid-sized companies.
    * Format: Organized and structured format for easy access and analysis.
Outcome - Monthly Sales Report:
* A monthly report or a simple dashboard showing key sales metrics.
    * Features:
    * Total sales per month.
    * Breakdown of sales by product category and store location.
    * Customer buying trends and patterns.
    * Inventory levels compared with sales data.
Sample Dataset:
For implementing this use case, you can use the "Sales and Inventory" dataset available on platforms like Kaggle. These datasets typically contain information about sales transactions, product details, and sometimes customer information. You can find a dataset like the "Retail Sales: Sales and Inventory" dataset on Kaggle, which should serve well for this use case.
Benefits:
* Tactical Decision Making: Monthly insights help in planning inventory, marketing strategies, and understanding customer preferences.
* Simplicity and Accessibility: Avoids the complexity of real-time data processing, making it suitable for small to mid-sized businesses.
* Scalability: Can evolve into a more sophisticated system with growing business needs.
This modified use case focuses on monthly sales analysis, which is more manageable and less complex than real-time analysis, making it a good starting point for learning and implementing basic ETL processes.
